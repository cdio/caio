# CEMU

CEMU is an emulator of 8 bit Home Computers.
The current status is **Work-in-Progress alpha** and only the Commodore 64
is emulated, under Linux.

## Compile & Install

CEMU requires [clang-10](https://clang.llvm.org) or later,
[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) 2.5.1 or later and
[pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config):

```
    $ sudo apt install clang
    ...
    $ sudo apt install libsfml-dev
    ...
    $ sudo apt install pkg-config
    ...
    $ make PREFIX=/usr/local
    ...
    $ sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install
```

The default *PREFIX* is */opt/cemu*.


## Usage

```
    $ cemu c64 --help
```
or
```
    $ c64 --help
```
All the command line options can be specified in a
[configuration file](/bin/cemu.conf).

To launch a program built in a CRT file:

```
    $ c64 --scanlines h --scale 4 --cart ./gyruss.crt
```
if it is a PRG file:

```
    $ c64 --prg ./rambo.prg
```


## Keyboard

The keyboard layout can be set using the *keymaps* configuration option
(the default is [US-ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ANSI_Keyboard_Layout_Diagram_with_Form_Factor.svg)).

For example, to use the italian layout:
```
    $ c64 --keymaps it
```
to use the [VICEKB](https://vice-emu.pokefinder.org/index.php/File:C64keyboard.gif)
positional layout:
```
    $ c64 --keymaps vice
```

At the moment the following layouts are available (not all of them tested):
* Italian (it)
* German (de)
* Swiss (ch)
* UK (gb)
* US-ANSI (default)
* VICEKB (vice)

Keyboard layouts are simple text files, existing layouts can be modified using
any text editor and new layouts can be added to the system by just placing the
new file inside the *keymasdir* directory which defaults to
*$PREFIX/share/cemu/keymaps*.

Like the [VICE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VICE) emulator, the *RESTORE*
key is mapped as *Page-Up*, *RUN/STOP* as *ESC*, *CTRL* as *TAB* and
*CBM* as *LEFT-CTRL*.


## Joysticks

Up to two gamepads should work (tested using only one Logitech F710).
The PS3 controller is known to work.


## Hot-Keys

* *ALT-F* toggles between *windowed* and *fullscreen* modes.

* *PAUSE* or *ALT-P* toggles between *pause* and *running* modes.

* *ALT-J* swaps joysticks #1 and #2.

* *ALT-M* enters the CPU monitor (if it is active).

* *CTRL-C* on the terminal enters the CPU monitor (if the monitor is not
  active the emulation is terminated).

* *ALT-V* toggles the visibility of the info panel.


## Disk Drive

There is a [C1541](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541) implementation that
access the host filesystem. Host directories are recursively traversed so it must be
used with care.

D64 files are not supported yet.

For more information please see the *--8* command line option.


## C64 SID Chip

The emulation of the MOS6581 chip is based on the specifications found on the
[C64 User's Guide](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Commodore_64_User%27s_Guide)
but since ["Many characteristics of the SID sound are bugs"](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SID#Trivia)
CEMU's implementation does not sound 100% like the original chip.
Nevertheless, the volume "click" bug and others are implemented so programs
like [SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Automatic_Mouth) work.

Besides the internal implementation, CEMU has a wrapper that uses the very
accurate [reSID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReSID) library; it can be
enabled using the *resid* option.


## Status

Although CEMU is usable, it is not finished and it is not free of bugs.
the chipset emulation is not 100% complete neither accurate.


## TODO

In no particular order:

* Finish Commodore 64
* Apple-2
* BBC Micro
* Daewoo DPC-200
* NEC PC-8001
* Amstrad CPC-464
* ZX Spectrum
