\section{Endianness}

The \mono{68705} is a big-endian machine. Byte ordering in words is high, then low.


\section{Adressing modes}

The \mono{68705} processor has a subset of the \mono{68hc908}\footnote{see chapter \ref{processor:MC68HC908}} instruction set. 
For addressing modes please refer to table \ref{special_address_modes_68hc908}. As a quick 
rule of thumb for comparison one can state the \mono{68705} processor is lacking all stack-pointer related 
and some few special instructions from the \mono{mc68hc908} processor.
