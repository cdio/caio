- ZX80:     Make it work
- Z80:      Refactor Z80 + undocumented instructions
            Eliminate callback tables ("If CB or ED is encountered, that byte
            plus the next make up an instruction. FD or DD should be seen as
            preﬁx setting a ﬂag which says “use IX or IY in stead of HL”, and
            not an instruction. In a large sequence of DD and FD bytes, it is
            the last one that counts. Also any other byte (or instruction)
            resets this ﬂag.")
