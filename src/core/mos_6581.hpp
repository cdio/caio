/**
 * MOS6581 implementation from the specs.
 * The real 6581 chip does not respect its own specifications
 * consequently this implementation does not sound exactly like the real chip.
 *
 * > "Can you give us a short overview of the SIDs internal architecture ?
 * > It's pretty brute-force, I didn't have time to be elegant. Each "voice" consisted of
 * > an Oscillator, a Waveform Generator, a Waveform Selector, a Waveform D/A converter,
 * > a Multiplying D/A converter for amplitude control and an Envelope Generator for modulation.
 * > The analog output of each voice could be sent through a Multimode Analog Filter or bypass
 * > the filter and a final Multiplying D/A converter provided overall manual volume control.
 * > As I recall, the Oscillator is a 24-bit phase-accumulating design of which thelower 16-bits
 * > are programmable for pitch control. The output of the accumulator goes directly to a D/A
 * > converter through a waveform selector. Normally, the output of a phase-accumulating
 * > oscillator would be used as an address into memory which contained a wavetable, but SID had
 * > to be entirely self-contained and there was no room at all for a wavetable on the chip.
 * >
 * > The Sawtooth waveform was created by sending the upper 12-bits of the accumulator to the
 * > 12-bit Waveform D/A.
 * >
 * > The Triangle waveform was created by using the MSB of the accumulator to invert the
 * > remaining upper 11 accumulator bits using EXOR gates. These 11 bits were then left-shifted
 * > (throwing away the MSB) and sent to the Waveform D/A (so the resolution of the triangle
 * > waveform was half that of the sawtooth, but the amplitude and frequency were the same).
 * > The Pulse waveform was created by sending the upper 12-bits of the accumulator to a 12-bit
 * > digital comparator. The output of the comparator was either a one or a zero. This single
 * > output was then sent to all 12 bits of the Waveform D/A.
 * >
 * > The Noise waveform was created using a 23-bit pseudo-random sequence generator (i.e., a
 * > shift register with specific outputs fed back to the input through combinatorial logic).
 * > The shift register was clocked by one of the intermediate bits of the accumulator to keep
 * > the frequency content of the noise waveform relatively the same as the pitched waveforms.
 * > The upper 12-bits of the shift register were sent to the Waveform D/A.
 * >
 * > Since all of the waveforms were just digital bits, the Waveform Selector consisted of
 * > multiplexers that selected which waveform bits would be sent to the Waveform D/A. The
 * > multiplexers were single transistors and did not provide a "lock-out", allowing
 * > combinations of the waveforms to be selected. The combination was actually a logical
 * > ANDing of the bits of each waveform, which produced unpredictable results, so I didn't
 * > encourage this, especially since it could lock up the pseudo-random sequence generator by
 * > filling it with zeroes.
 * >
 * > The output of the Waveform D/A (which was an analog voltage at this point) was fed into
 * > the reference input of an 8-bit multiplying D/A, creating a DCA (digitally-controlled-amplifier).
 * > The digital control word which modulated the amplitude of the waveform came from the
 * > Envelope Generator.
 * >
 * > The Envelope Generator was simply an 8-bit up/down counter which, when triggered by the
 * > Gate bit, counted from 0 to 255 at the Attack rate, from 255 down to the programmed
 * > Sustain value at the Decay rate, remained at the Sustain value until the Gate bit was
 * > cleared then counted down from the Sustain value to 0 at the Release rate.
 * >
 * > A programmable frequency divider was used to set the various rates (unfortunately I don't
 * > remember how many bits the divider was, either 12 or 16 bits). A small look-up table
 * > translated the 16 register-programmable values to the appropriate number to load into
 * > the frequency divider. Depending on what state the Envelope Generator was in
 * > (i.e. ADS or R), the appropriate register would be selected and that number would be
 * > translated and loaded into the divider. Obviously it would have been better to have
 * > individual bit control of the divider which would have provided great resolution for each
 * > rate, however I did not have enough silicon area for a lot of register bits. Using this
 * > approach, I was able to cram a wide range of rates into 4 bits, allowing the ADSR to be
 * > defined in two bytes instead of eight. The actual numbers in the look-up table were
 * > arrived at subjectively by setting up typical patches on a Sequential Circuits Pro-1
 * > and measuring the envelope times by ear (which is why the available rates seem strange)!
 * >
 * > In order to more closely model the exponential decay of sounds, another look-up table on
 * > the output of the Envelope Generator would sequentially divide the clock to the Envelope
 * > Generator by two at specific counts in the Decay and Release cycles. This created a
 * > piece-wise linear approximation of an exponential. I was particularly happy how well
 * > this worked considering the simplicity of the circuitry. The Attack, however, was linear,
 * > but this sounded fine.
 * >
 * > A digital comparator was used for the Sustain function. The upper four bits of the Up/Down
 * > counter were compared to the programmed Sustain value and would stop the clock to the
 * > Envelope Generator when the counter counted down to the Sustain value. This created 16
 * > linearly spaced sustain levels without havingto go through a look-up table translation
 * > between the 4-bit register value and the 8-bit Envelope Generator output. It also meant
 * > that sustain levels were adjustable in steps of 16. Again, more register bits would have
 * > provided higher resolution.
 * >
 * > When the Gate bit was cleared, the clock would again be enabled, allowing the counter to
 * > count down to zero. Like an analog envelope generator, the SID Envelope Generator would
 * > track the Sustain level if it was changed to a lower value during the Sustain portion of
 * > the envelope, however, it would not count UP if the Sustain level were set higher.
 * > The 8-bit output of the Envelope Generator was then sent to the Multiplying D/A converter
 * > to modulate the amplitude of the selected Oscillator Waveform (to be technically accurate,
 * > actually the waveform was modulating the output of the Envelope Generator, but the
 * > result is the same).
 * >
 * > Hard Sync was accomplished by clearing the accumulator of an Oscillator based on the
 * > accumulator MSB of the previous oscillator.
 * >
 * > Ring Modulation was accomplished by substituting the accumulator MSB of an oscillator
 * > in the EXOR function of the triangle waveform generator with the accumulator MSB of the
 * > previous oscillator. That is why the triangle waveform must be selected to use
 * > Ring Modulation.
 * >
 * > The Filter was a classic multi-mode (state variable) VCF design. There was no way to
 * > create a variable transconductance amplifier in our NMOS process, so I simply used FETs
 * > as voltage-controlled resistors to control the cutoff frequency. An 11-bit D/A converter
 * > generates the control voltage for the FETs (it's actually a 12-bit D/A, but the LSB had
 * > no audible affect so I disconnected it!).
 * > Filter resonance was controlled by a 4-bit weighted resistor ladder. Each bit would turn
 * > on one of the weighted resistors and allow a portion of the output to feed back to the
 * > input. The state-variable design provided simultaneous low-pass, band-pass and high-pass
 * > outputs. Analog switches selected which combination of outputs were sent to the final
 * > amplifier (a notch filter was created by enabling both the high and low-pass outputs
 * > simultaneously).
 * >
 * > The filter is the worst part of SID because I could not create high-gain op-amps in NMOS,
 * > which were essential to a resonant filter. In addition, the resistance of the FETs
 * > varied considerably with processing, so different lots of SID chips had different
 * > cutoff frequency characteristics. I knew it wouldn't work very well, but it was better
 * > than nothing and I didn't have time to make it better.
 * > Analog switches were also used to either route an Oscillator output through or around
 * > the filter to the final amplifier. The final amp was a 4-bit multiplying D/A converter
 * > which allowed the volume of the output signal to be controlled. By stopping an Oscillator,
 * > it was possible to apply a DC voltage to this D/A. Audio could then be created by having
 * > the microprocessor write the Final Volume register in real-time. Game programs often used
 * > this method to synthesize speech or play "sampled" sounds.
 * > An external audio input could also be mixed in at the final amp or processed through the
 * > filter.
 * >
 * > The Modulation registers were probably never used since they could easily be simulated in
 * > software without having to give up a voice. For novice programmers they provided a way to
 * > create vibrato or filter sweeps without having to write much code (just read the value
 * > from the modulation register and write it back to the frequency register). These registers
 * > just give microprocessor access to the upper 8 bits of the instantaneous value of the
 * > waveform and envelope of Voice 3. Since you probably wouldn't want to hear the modulation
 * > source in the audio output, an analog switch was provided to turn off the audio output
 * > of Voice 3."
